    <dl>
      <dt>What is unglish?</dt>
      <dd>It's a language that sounds like english, but isn't... yet.</dd>
      <dt>What's the goal?</dt>
      <dd>To build many worlds of impossible to understand gibberish, that each have a graceful internal coherence. There will be heaps of poetry and prose. Conversations and disagreements. Idle thoughts and musings.</dd>
      <dt>What versioning system do you use?</dt>
      <dd>unglish is versioned using a base<abbr title="Iterative Deviation to Grammatically Achieve Function">IDGAF</abbr> system. We start with `a`. And then we'll cycle through `e`, `i`, `o` and `u`. And then we'll loop back to `a` and add a the lowest indexed english consonant: `ab`. At some point, we'll add spaces and punction. And eventually, if we iterate high enough, maybe we'll have written a novel.</dd>
      <dt>Who is authorized to produce unglish words?</dt>
      <dd>Nobody, and so everybody.</dd>
