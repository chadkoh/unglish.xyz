    <dl>
      <dt>What is unglish?</dt>
      <dd>It's a language that sounds like english, but isn't... yet.</dd>
      <dt>What's the goal?</dt>
      <dd>To build many worlds of impossible to understand gibberish, that each have a graceful internal coherence. There will be heaps of poetry and prose. Conversations and disagreements. Idle thoughts and musings.</dd>
      <dt>What versioning system do you use?</dt>
      <dd>unglish is versioned using a base<abbr title="Iterative Deviation to Grammatically Achieve Function">IDGAF</abbr> system. We start with `a`. And then we'll cycle through `e`, `i`, `o` and `u`. And then we'll loop back to `a` and add a the lowest indexed english consonant: `ab`. At some point, we'll add spaces and punction. And eventually, if we iterate high enough, maybe we'll have written a novel.</dd>

      <dt>What's the roadmap?</dt>
      <dd>Great question. I'll be as brief and vague as I can. 🏗️: <em>Words</em> → Definitions → Grammar → Writing. 👂: <em>IPA english phonemes</em> → other phonetic systems → all phonemes. 🗣️: <em>SpeechSynthesisAPI</em> → SSML? → Custom Voices? 🧮: <em>1</em> → 2 → ♾️<br/><br/>All told, I think it'll take 50 years, give or take a century.</dd>
